Dear Kathy ,
1.  BioSample attributes file - please find the file in attachment, edit it and send back to me
2. you can make spreadsheet-like updates of SRA metadata  in DataView  interface  https://dataview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/object/PRJNA693865
3. removal and addition of several fastq files -  we cannot replace loaded files, please provide run accessions that you want to be withdrawn; to add new sequence data to the bioproject (and/or biosamples)  please make new SRA submission and use this bioproject's and corresponding biosamples' (if applicable) accessions for SRA metadata. Please note that you either can use existing biosamples in the SRA submission or create all new ones - you cannot mix and match.
